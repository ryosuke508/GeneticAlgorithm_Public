# Abstract
This repository presents a real-coded genetic algorithm using JGG as the transgenerational model and AREX as the crossover method.

# Optimization Problem
The optimization problem shall be the minimization problem in the two-dimensional Ackley function shown below.

# Optimization Result
The convergence process is shown. It can be confirmed that the convergence is toward the optimal solution (0,0).
